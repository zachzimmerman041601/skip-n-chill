# Troubleshooting

* if download executable not working on mac run ```xattr -cr YouTubeAdSkipper.app```
* also on mac: The "until you close the app" issue happens with unsigned apps. macOS doesn't persist permissions properly for apps that aren't code-signed Fix: Manually add the app to permissions (persists): Open System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording Click the + button
Navigate to the .app and add it
Open System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility Click the + button
Add the same .app
